LearnUnity
==========

These are the chapter projects for the book Learn Unity 4 for iOS Game Development. These Unity projects require Unity 4.6 or later and do not include the free Asset Store assets and Standard Assets used in the book.

An app featuring the complete assets is available on the Asset Store, Google Play, the Amazon Appstore and the Nook as Learn Unity.

Please see http://learnunity4.com/ for corrections and updates about the book, apps and code.
