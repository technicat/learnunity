Download and install Unity, license activation, bug reporting, getting help.\r\n2. Angry Bots demo, built-in and custom layouts, the Scene, Game, Hierarchy, Inspector and Project Views, how to open a project, open a scene and play a scene.\r\n3. Create a new scene with primitive objects, lighting, skybox, camera control, importing Standard Assets, and making prefabs.\r\n4. Create scripts, understanding callbacks, editing with MonoDevelop, debugging with MonoDevelop.\r\n5. Create a dancing skeleton scene by importing a free skeleton package from the Asset Store, selecting and looping a dance animation, importing and looping music, adding a floor, activating dynamic shadows.\r\n6. Start a new bowling game scene: add a bowling ball, add physics materials and rigidbodies, script a physics-based bowing ball controls.\r\n7. Add bowling pins, a bowling ball game controller, pin collision sounds, ball rolling sound, collision callbacks.\r\n8. Implement complete bowling game rules as a finite state machine, using coroutines.\r\n9. Implement a scoreboard and pause menu using UnityGUI.\r\n10. Build Angry Bots as an iOS app, testing it in the Editor with Unity Remote and on the iOS Simulator in Xcode.\r\n11. Set up provisioning profiles and test devices on the Provisioning Portal, setting up an app on iTunes Connect, build and run Angry Bots for testing and distribution.\r\n12. Back to bowling: adding icons and splash screens, specifying screen orientation, scaling UnityGUI for different screen resolutions.\r\n13. Add touchscreen controls, detecting shakes with the accelerometer, displaying a video texture with the iOS camera as a webcam.\r\n14. Add Game Center leaderboards and achievements.\r\n15. Add banner and interstitial (full-screen) ads with iAd.\r\n16. Run the built-in and Editor-based profiler, optimizing code and assets for speed, size and/or quality.\r\n17. Misc topics: Android, C#, Editor scripting, script execution order, publishing on the Asset Store.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Asset Store\r\n\r\nThe book utilizes free packages from the Unity Asset Store:\r\n\r\n* [Eighteen Free Substances](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/#/content/1352) from [Allegorithmic](http://allegorithmic.com)\r\n* [Free ArtskillZ Texture Pack 01](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/#/content/351) from [ArtskillZ](http://artskillz.net)\r\n* [Skeletons Pack](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/#/content/1818) from [bisaniyehocam](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/#/publisher/645)\r\n* [General Music Set](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/#/content/2589) from [Gianmarco Leone](http://gianmarcoleone.com/)\r\n* [Free SFX Package](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/#/content/5178) from [Bleep Blop Audio](http://bleepblopaudio.com/)\r\n* [Barrel](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/#/content/840) from [Universal Image](http://monstertruckherohd.com/)\r\n* [iTween](http://itween.pixelplacement.com) from [Pixel Placement](http://pixelplacement.com)\r\n\r\n# Support\r\n\r\nQuestions can be posted on the [Unity forum](http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/173210-Learn-Unity-for-iOS-Game-Development), any of my Facebook pages ([Technicat](http://facebook.com/technicatllc), [Fugu Games](http://facebook.com/fugugames) or [HyperBowl](http://facebook.com/hyperbowl)) and on [twitter](http://twitter.com/fugugames).\r\n\r\n# Corrections and Clarifications\r\n\r\n## Retail Description\r\n\r\n* Some retail descriptions list Unity's Mecanim animation system. The book does mention but does not use Mecanim. Instead, a chapter is devoted to a dancing skeleton example using Unity's Legacy animation system and a free skeleton package on the Asset Store.\r\n* Some retail descriptions list Unity's support for gyroscope on iOS devices. The book does mention but does not use Unity's gyroscope API (Input.gyroscope). The book does describe how to access the touchscreen (Input.touches), accelerometer (Input.accelerometer), and webcam (WebCamTexture).\r\n\r\n## Ebooks\r\n\r\n### Apress alpha\r\n\r\n* Hasn't been updated to the final copy.\r\n\r\n### Nook\r\n\r\n* URL's display with markup and are not active as links.\r\n* All the quoted titles in the Explore Further sections should be links to the Unity online documentation (for the Scripting Reference pages, try searching for those terms in the Scripting Reference search box).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Kindle\r\n\r\n* Figure links don't always work.\r\n* Same issue as the nook re missing links in the Explore Further sections.\r\n\r\n## Text\r\n\r\n### About the Author\r\n\r\n* page xxi: Snow Crash should be italicized.
